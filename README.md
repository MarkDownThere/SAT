Simulation Analysis Training. A mini-course on the analysis of molecular simulations offered by me for the EUTOPIA COST action academy.

## Create the conda environment

After cloning the repository, open a terminal and go to the repository folder. There you can setup the conda environment with:

```
conda env create -f conda_env_sat.yml
```

## Activate the environment

## Run the notebook

From the terminal, run:

If you are not interested in running the calculations interactively, a pdf version of the notebook is present in this folder.
